He found it admirable to see that despite all the hard work and effort put in by his father and his staff, they all still managed to enjoy themselves with laughter always filling the kitchen.</p><p>Sriram gave up his law studies for his first love and in 1984 he joined the Institute of Hotel Management, Catering Technology and Applied Nutrition in India. His father recognised his culinary talent from a very young age and gave him the responsibility of ‘working partner’ in the business, even though he was still young and in college. “It gave me the overall perspective of the restaurant. It was the best training I ever received.”</p>"
